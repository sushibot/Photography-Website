# Photography-Website
Small website project to showcase my friend Jolly's, photography. The intent of this website was to go through the motions of planning and creating a website from scratch and provide a hub to promote Jolly's photography. 

Goals of this website:
1. Create a fully responsive website using CSS Grids
2. Use JotForms to create a contact page 
3. Visualize an _Audience Tracker_ and _most liked pictures_ Graph with Google Analytics and D3
4. Optimize website speeds for faster image loading
5. Create a Parasoul viewer for the picture Gallery 
6. Implement a liking feature that allows Jolly to see which photo's are most liked



As of now, the website is live but I will be implementing goals 3-6 soon. Later on, I plan on revamping the entire website using either React or Angular as a case study.
