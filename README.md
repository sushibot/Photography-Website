# Photography-Website
Small website project to showcase my friend Jolly's, photography. The intent of this website was to go through the motions of planning and creating a website from scratch and provide a hub to promote Jolly's photography.

Goals of this website:
1. Create a fully responsive website using CSS Grids
2. Implement a liking feature that allows Jolly to see which photo's are most liked
3. Visualize an Audience Tracker Graph with Google Analytics 
4. Optimize website speeds for faster image loading
5. Create a Parasoul viewer for the picture Gallery 

As of now, the website is live but I will be adding changes and updating features soon. Later on, I plan on revamping the entire website using either React or Angular as a case study.
